    <h2>NILE</h2>
    </h1>
    <P>The Nile is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is
        the longest river in Africa and has historically been considered the longest river in the world, though this has
        been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer</P>
